# pySearch


pySearch is a simple command line python script that opens a new browser tab to search the input string. pySearch allows for seamlessly performing a web search without removing your hands off the keyboard. 

Normally, someone working on a command line interface, to perform a web search a user would need to take one hand off the keyboard, start/navigate to their browser with their mouse (or alt+tab however they would still need to navigate to the search bar with the mouse) and then take their hand off the mouse so they can use the keyboard to type their search. 

pySearch simplifies this to a single command line command.

## Goals 

The goal of pySearch is to bring web search capabilities to your command line so initiating a web search doesn't require taking your hand off the keyboard. The current goal is to integrate as much of the web search workflow into the command line so users can get all the keyboard interaction out of the way before taking one hand off the keyboard to use the mouse to interact with the browser.

###Specific Goals 

Support basic webcrawling which would allow basic searches, basic dictionary lookup would be a great test case for this, to be performed before opening a browser. (think Unix man pages)

Basic browser interactivity through pySearch. The ability to navigate and control your browser using pySearch (so scrolling, selecting and opening search links, open a new tab). While it allows keyboard interactivity with the browser while inside the command line, pySearch's interactive mode shouldn't impede the user's ability to use command line commands so it should have the ability to pipe command line commands to the shell and return their output to the user.
